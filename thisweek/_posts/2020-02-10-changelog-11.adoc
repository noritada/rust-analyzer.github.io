Commit: commit:5b703bdc582be427ee62d250b3d3290165c36b8c[] +
Release: release:2020-02-10[]

== New Features

* pr:3053[] VS Code extension now tries to automatically download the latest release.
  Additionally, the extension is now published to the Marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer[link]).
  Note that if you want to continue using rust-analyzer build from sources, you need to add
+
[source,json]
----
{
      "rust-analyzer.raLspServerPath": "ra_lsp_server"
}
----
+
to `settings.json`

* pr:2981[] changed the way `onEnter` handler works in VS Code.
  We no longer register a custom `ontype` command.
  Instead, we provide a shortcut, bound to kbd:[Enter].
  If you have `enableEnhancedTyping: false` in you settings, you'll want to disable this shortcut.
* pr:3050[] implement argument-position `impl Trait` again (support for `impl Trait` was removed with the Chalk upgrade last week). Return-position `impl Trait` support will still have to wait for Chalk.
* pr:2911[] display errors from the lexer.
* pr:2962[] groundwork for `use Trait as _` syntax.
* pr:2948[] **Add Explicit Type** assist now can replace `_` types.
* pr:3040[] rework value parameter parsing to use 2018 edition syntax.
* pr:3054[] move Emacs support upstream.


== Fixes

* pr:3017[] correctly handle crates with `-` in names.
* pr:3044[] don't crash when receiving unknown file for cargo diagnostics.
* pr:3047[] fix parsing of `async unsafe` functions.

== Internal Improvements

* pr:3024[] fix leaking observers and promises in VS Code extension.
* pr:3001[], pr:3003[] reduce the number of TypeScript dependencies.
* pr:3018[], pr:3045[] refactor some assists to use type-safe AST editing API.
* pr:3031[], pr:3034[], pr:3063[] refactor auto-import infrastructure.
* pr:3069[] refactor interface for creating assists groups.
* pr:3081[] automate release process.
* pr:3029[] extract `ra_ide_db` crate to improve compile times and code organization.
* https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer.github.io/pull/31[`rust-analyzer.github.io#31`] switch changelogs from markdown to AsciiDoctor.
* Bump NodeJS requirement to 12 (you only need node if you build VS Code extension from source).
