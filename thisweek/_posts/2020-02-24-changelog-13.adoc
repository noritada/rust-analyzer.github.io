Release: release:2020-02-24[]

== New Features

* pr:3216[] language server binary is renamed from `ra_lsp_server` to `rust-analyzer`.
  Additionally, `rust-analyzer.lspServerPath` config is renamed to `rust-analyzer.serverPath`

* pr:3199[], pr:3200[] merge `ra_cli` batch processing utils with the main `rust-analyzer` binary.
  Now you can, eg, run `rust-analyzer analysis-stats path/to/my/project` to type check all functions in batch.
  This is intended to help with debugging rust-analyzer itself.

* pr:3206[] automatically install `rust-src` component.
* pr:3231[] add **Remove mut** assist.
* pr:3252[] for syntax highlighting, take token color customization into account.
* pr:3269[] document inlay hints.
* pr:3278[], pr:3279[] show inlay hints in more cases.
* pr:3275[] document structural search and replace.
